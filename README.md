This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

# Creating Components, Pages, Services and Modules
## Modules
Be in the root directory then run `ng generate module ModuleName -m app`

## Components
Be in your directory of choice (normally a module) and run `ng generate component ComponentName -m ModuleName`

## Service
Be in your directory of choice (normally a module) and run `ng generate service ServiceName -m ModuleName`

## Page
Be in your directory of choice (normally a module) and run `ng generate component PageName -m ModuleName`
There are extra steps required where you have to rename your component from `page-name.component.ts|html|css|spec` to `page-name.page.ts|html|css|spec`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
